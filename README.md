# Flight_Delays


Introduction
The purpose of the project is to predict “How Long a Flight Will be Delay at the Destination Airport”? In 2015 there were lots of flight delays in the United States. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the status of the flights by providing a summary of the arrival delays, departure delays, scheduled departure, on-time arrival in their monthly report.
